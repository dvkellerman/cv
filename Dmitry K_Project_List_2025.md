| Project description:  | This project involves the development of an advanced iOS application ( IEC 62304 standard) designed to manage insulin delivery for diabetic patients using a hybrid closed-loop system. By leveraging sensor glucose readings, the app intelligently and automatically adjusts insulin doses delivered via an insulin pump to optimize glycemic control. Specifically, I developed SDK’s for Freestyle Libre 3 and Dexcom G6 sensors. The application utilizes CoreNFC for seamless communication with NFC-enabled glucose sensors and CoreBLE for reliable Bluetooth connectivity with insulin pumps. This combination ensures real-time data acquisition and control, enhancing patient safety and improving diabetes management outcomes.To ensure the security of data transmission and protect patient information, the app incorporates OpenSSL, providing robust encryption for all communications within the app.  iXGuard was used to obfuscate the code and add additional runtime protection for the app binary.  |
